<h1 class="slide-Heading">Implementation & Timeline Assumptions​</h1>
<!-- Box 1 -->
<div class="box">
<h3>PROJECT SCOPE AND TIMELINES</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<b class="colorBold">Discovery Phase Deliverables:</b>
Discovery Phase Deliverables: PartnerRe will provide all necessary business requirements, use cases, and stakeholder inputs as needed during the discovery phase to finalize the product releases backlog. Any delays in providing this information may impact timelines.​<p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b class="colorBold">Flexibility in Scope:</b>
The proposed implementation follows a <b>Fixed capacity model</b>. Any additions or changes to the agreed scope after Sprint 0 (discovery), will be treated as change requests and may result in revised timelines and costs. Xebia will ensure to cater any critical feedbacks in the current release to ensure the release is providing value to the end users, but this can be subjected to the impact it might have on timeline and cost.​<p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b class="colorBold">Project Timeline Dependencies:</b>
Timelines are based on the assumption that all PartnerRe approvals, data inputs, and integrations are provided on time. Delays in these will impact the overall schedule​<p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<!-- Box 2 -->
<div class="box">
<h3>INFRASTRUCTURE AND RESOURCES</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<b class="colorBold">Infrastructure Readiness:</b>
PartnerRe is responsible for procuring and setting up the necessary infrastructure (project management tools and others as needed), Appian environments, and licensing before the development kick-off. Any delays or unavailability of these will impact timelines and are outside Xebia’s control.​<p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b class="colorBold">Integration Readiness:</b>
It is assumed that PartnerRe will provide APIs and system integration details. Xebia will not be accountable for delays caused by missing or incomplete integration readiness. Xebia's efforts include consuming these integrations API inside Appian for different underwriting processes.​<p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b class="colorBold">Testing Environments:</b>
PartnerRe will ensure the availability of a production-like testing environment for end-to-end testing. Delays in providing this environment will affect project progress.​<p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b class="colorBold">Project Resources:</b>
All the team working on the project from Xebia side will be remote/ off-shore. Xebia has offices in UK/ Europe, Teams based out of them can participate in the project as required.​<p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<!-- Box 3 -->
<div class="box">
<h3>COLLABORATION AND GOVERNANCE</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<b class="colorBold">Single Point of Contact (SPOC):</b>
PartnerRe will assign a dedicated IT SPOC to coordinate requirements, integration details, and approvals. Delays caused by the absence of a SPOC will impact the project timeline.<p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b class="colorBold">Stakeholder Approvals:</b>
Any delays in obtaining approvals from PartnerRe stakeholders during UAT phases may impact delivery timelines and are not Xebia's responsibility.<p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="red-para">*These assumptions are based on the current understanding and will be revisited and refined during the discovery phase (Sprint 0) to align with finalized project details.​</p>
